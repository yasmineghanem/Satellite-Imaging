    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that iteratively learn from data and improve their accuracy over time by optimizing an error metric, typically through the use of loss functions. These functions quantify the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs, guiding the algorithm to minimize this error during training. By continually adjusting and improving, machine learning models can achieve remarkable accuracy in tasks ranging from simple classification to complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized kind of neural networks particularly effective for analyzing visual imagery. They employ a mathematical operation known as convolution, which uses sliding window techniques to process data. This method is highly efficient in recognizing patterns and features in images due to the sparse interactions and parameter sharing of convolutional layers. These characteristics allow CNNs to capture local patterns like edges and textures with a significantly reduced amount of parameters compared to fully connected networks, making them highly efficient for tasks involving high-dimensional data like images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of CNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) typically includes several key components, each playing a crucial role in the network's ability to process and interpret visual information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convolutional Layers**: \n",
    "  - Apply a number of filters to the input.\n",
    "  - Create feature maps that capture essential details within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pooling Layers**: \n",
    "  - Often follow convolutional layers.\n",
    "  - Reduce the spatial size of the feature maps, decreasing the computational load.\n",
    "  - Extract dominant features that are invariant to small changes in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fully Connected Layers**: \n",
    "  - Interpret the features extracted by convolutional and pooling layers.\n",
    "  - Perform classification or regression tasks based on the interpreted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Softmax Layer**:\n",
    "  - Typically used in the final layer if the task is classification.\n",
    "  - Outputs the probabilities of the instance belonging to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropout Layers**:\n",
    "  - Included to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "  - Randomly drop units from the neural network during the training process to improve generalization.\n",

    "\n",
    "In training neural networks, various hyperparameters must be predefined to guide the training process. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Size**\n",
    "  - **Definition**: Number of training examples used per iteration.\n",
    "  - **Common Values**: 32, 64, 128, 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**\n",
    "  - **Definition**: Step size at each iteration to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "  - **Common Values**: Often starts small, e.g., 0.01, 0.001, and can be dynamically adjusted (lowered as we get nearer to minima, check scheduers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimizer Type**\n",
    "  - **Examples**: SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad.\n",
    "  - **Role**: Different optimizers affect training dynamics and model performance differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beta Parameters for Adam Optimizer**\n",
    "  - **Beta1 and Beta2**: Control the decay rates of moving averages of past gradients and squared gradients.\n",
    "  - **Common Values**: Beta1 = 0.9, Beta2 = 0.999.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epochs**\n",
    "  - **Definition**: One full pass of the training dataset through the learning algorithm.\n",
    "  - **Usage**: More epochs can lead to better learning but risk overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Momentum**\n",
    "  - **Definition**: Helps accelerate SGD and dampens oscillations.\n",
    "  - **Common Values**: 0.9, 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameters (L1 & L2)**\n",
    "  - **Purpose**: Prevent overfitting by adding a penalty on the size of the coefficients.\n",
    "  - **Parameters**: Lambda or alpha values for L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropout Rate**\n",
    "  - **Definition**: Fraction of neurons to randomly drop during training.\n",
    "  - **Common Values**: 0.2, 0.3, 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Layers and Number of Neurons in Each Layer**\n",
    "  - **Role**: Determines the architecture's depth and width, affecting its ability to capture complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Function Type for Classification with Softmax**\n",
    "  - **Definition**: Cross-entropy loss, also known as log loss.\n",
    "  - **Purpose**: Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label (an alternative can be Categorical Hinge Loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stopping**\n",
    "  - **Purpose**: Halt training when performance on a validation set starts to worsen to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lab is graded based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Preparation (2 Marks)**\n",
    "   - Correctly loads images for the residential, river, and forest classes. (1 Mark)\n",
    "   - Accurately splits the dataset into training, validation testing subsets and clearly shows this split. (1 Mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CNN Architecture (3 Marks)**\n",
    "   - Uses appropriate CNN Architecture to the problem with a full pipeline. (2 Marks)\n",
    "   - Justifies the selection of CNN architecture. (1 Mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameters Tuning (2 Marks)**\n",
    "   - Report evaluation metrics on validation set. (1 Mark)\n",
    "   - Analyzes results and tunes hyperparameters. (1 Mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation and Understanding (3 Marks)**\n",
    "   - Shows **confusion matrix** and correctly calculates and clearly shows the calculations for Accuracy and Average F1 Score. (1 Mark)\n",
    "   - **Comparison amongst your peers.** Compares the model's performance against those of peers to identify strengths and areas for improvement. (2 Marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section of the lab will be evaluated on completeness, and correctness in approach and analysis. Part of the rubric also includes the student's ability to explain and justify their choices and results.\n"
