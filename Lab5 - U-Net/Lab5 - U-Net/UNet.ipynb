    "\n",
    "U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation. First introduced in a 2015 paper by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox, its architecture is notably shaped like the letter \"U\", which inspired its name. This structure comprises a contracting path to capture context and a symmetrically expanding path that aids in precise localization, making it particularly adept at leveraging small datasets to achieve highly accurate segmentations. U-Net's ability to accurately segment various tissues and medical conditions has made it a staple in medical imaging and has spurred adaptations for broader image analysis applications. Its success in the medical domain demonstrates its potential for high-impact applications in other fields requiring detailed image segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "U-Net's robust architecture has found significant applications in the field of satellite imaging as well. The ability of U-Net to effectively handle multi-scale and high-resolution images makes it particularly suitable for satellite image analysis. In satellite imaging, U-Net is commonly used for tasks such as land cover classification, road detection, and building segmentation. Its structure allows for precise segmentation of complex objects from high-resolution satellite imagery, even with relatively limited labeled datasets. This capability is crucial in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management, where accurate and detailed image analysis is required. The adaptability and efficiency of U-Net in handling spatial hierarchies and various textures present in satellite images highlight its versatility and effectiveness beyond its initial medical context.\n",

Image segmentation involves dividing an image into segments that represent different objects or regions, which is crucial in various applications such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite image analysis.\n",

Each segment in the mask is represented by a unique color or grayscale intensity, where each intensity level corresponds to a different class (shape).\n",
    "- **Function of the Mask**: The mask serves as a \"ground truth\" for training the segmentation model. The model learns to predict these masks from the input images. Essentially, the task of the model is to map the input image to its corresponding output mask, segmenting the shapes it has learned during training.\n",
